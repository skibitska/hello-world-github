 
Knock Knock
Tell me where you are
I know that I’m close
But we’re apart
Somebody told me you were here
Somebody told me...
Wish I could ever find you
Wish I could ever find you, hey...

Ring ring
Please pick up the phone
I know that I'm asking for too much
I swear I promise you that I'm
not gonna say a word
If you don't wanna listen
Listen, is there something I could do?

Please don’t leave me in the morning
Tell me everything is gonna be right
I said oh baby, don’t leave me alone
This Saturday night

Knock knock
Tell me who you are
Who and what are you looking for?
Just show me where you’re going to
Or at least let me know
If I could ever find
If I could ever find you, hey...

Please don’t leave me in the morning
Tell me everything is gonna be right
I said oh baby, don’t leave me alone
This Saturday night
