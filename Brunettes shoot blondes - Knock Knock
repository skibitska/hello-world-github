 
Knock Knock
Tell me where you are
I know that I’m close
But we’re apart
Somebody told me you were here
Somebody told me...
Wish I could ever find you
Wish I could ever find you, hey...

Ring ring
Please pick up the phone
I know that I'm asking for too much
I swear I promise you that I'm
not gonna say a word
If you don't wanna listen
Listen, is there something I could do?
